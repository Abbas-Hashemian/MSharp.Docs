# M# Practice challenges

To learn M# properly, the best way is by doing. Every M# feature provides a shortcut way to implement a current requirement quickly, without having to write the full code. These features are defined under the how-to sections of this documentation. You should try to have a quick read to make yourself familiar with those. But to properly learn them, you should use them practically. That's why the M# tutorials are defined in the following format.

There are 22 practice projects that you should implement using M#. Each one should normally take less than an hours, and some maybe a bit longer. Each project is defined using a wireframe that explains what the software should do and how it should be structured. These wireframes are straight forward, but you should make sure to understand them fully before implementing.

To successfully build each practice project, you will be using and reusing some M# skills that you will have gained previously, plus one or two new skills and M# features. Links are provided for each one to the how-to documentation pages of specifically those new features.
