# How to: Creating an Enum (reference) type

## Problem:
... 
(TODO: Explain the need for enum types, i.e. types where a pre defined number of records exist for that type, and which are well known to the application at compile time, and that we can write business logic code against those values...)

## The M# way
...
(TODO: Explain the reasons why instead of regular C# Enum type (which are integers in fact), we use regular entities that are database driven because then you can add additional data properties or methods on top of the enum entities like any other entity....)

## How to implement
...
(TODO: Explain InstanceAccessors setting, the need for ReferenceData.cs code, ...)

#### Example
```c#
...
```

#### Generated code
```c#
...
```

## Remarks
