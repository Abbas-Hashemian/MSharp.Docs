# TransientEntity

### \[TransientEntity\]
is an attribute generated by M# to set an entity as transient and not linked to the database. You can find a more complete description of what a transient entity is and how to create it in [here](https://github.com/Geeksltd/MSharp.Docs/blob/master/Domain/Transient.md).

A transient entity could be used for example to keep payment details for processing and get the response from the payment gateway.
