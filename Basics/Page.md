# What is an M# Page?

Pages are fundamental for any web application and are required to display content on the website.
M# provides this feature within #UI project. Pages created here are placed under `Pages` folder of the Visual Studioâ€™s Web Application Project.

For example, M# generates a default "Login" page when a project is created.

**Page Name**:

This option allows the developer to specify the name of the page. This option works as the title and actual name of the page.
Page names with white spaces are assembled using SEO standards e.g. A page name "Hello world" will have a URL "Hello-world".
