# What is M#?

M# is a model-driven declarative programming model intended for developing data-focused .NET web applications. M# CLI (msharp.exe) will transform everything into standard ASP.NET MVC and C# project source code. So it's safe to adopt for mission critical projects.

## Is C# not enough?
In business applications there are common code patterns that repeat over and over. They are vast, yet slow and error-prone to write manually. Although similar, but they are not identical which is why code-reuse methods don't work there.
